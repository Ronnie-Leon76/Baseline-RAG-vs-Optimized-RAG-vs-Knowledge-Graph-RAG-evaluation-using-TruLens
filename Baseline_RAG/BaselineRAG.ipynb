NGOs can build their resilience by accessing tailored assistance, such as awareness training, dark web monitoring, phishing simulations and website vulnerability scanning.\\n\\n9\\n\\nCyberPeace Analytical Report', metadata={'id': '6_5_CyberPeace_Report.pdf_7', 'type': 'text', 'filename': '5_CyberPeace_Report.pdf', 'page_number': 7}), Document(page_content='Introduction\\n\\nIn the heart of International Geneva, a diverse ecosystem thrives, housing 38 international organizations (IOs), 432 non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and several hundred associations active at an international level, all united by a shared mission: to make the world a place of greater humanity, peace and justice. NGOs are the unsung heroes, responding in armed conflicts, natural disasters, and humanitarian crises, championing human rights, and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Like many other organizations, NGOs heavily rely on technology, which is critical for projecting their activities globally in real time. Yet, in today’s digital landscape, this reality brings its own set of challenges.\\n\\nWhile fighting for the greater good, NGOs must battle against all forms of cyberattacks, ranging from espionage and ransomware to fraud and disinformation. On one side, they are targeted by various threat actors - criminal groups, state actors, terrorist groups or hacktivists - seeking to disrupt their work, compromise data, and tarnish their reputation. On the other, they do not possess the human or financial resources to protect themselves.\\n\\nIn Geneva, the CyberPeace Institute safeguards these heroes. Our cybersecurity services for NGOs include threat landscape mapping, volunteer-led consulting, alert notifications, and providing policy recommendations to donors and public/private decision-makers. All these services are free and tailored to the NGOs’ operational reality.\\n\\nWith the leadership and support of the Republic and Canton of Geneva, this report aims to provide actionable recommendations to build capacities and resilience to mitigate cyber risks. It provides insights on the organizational readiness of NGOs to prevent, respond to and recover from cyberattacks. Using data, including primary data from surveys and interviews, the Report looks at the threats NGOs face, the vulnerabilities they are exposed to, and examines their preparedness to mitigate these challenges. Its ambition is to reinforce NGOs’ resilience in a sustainable manner, and for them to become the primary actors of their cybersecurity.\\n\\nThis report builds on technical analysis conducted by our cyber analysts and a comprehensive survey with 27 Geneva-based NGOs.\\n\\n6\\n\\nCyberPeace Institute | 2023\\n\\nThe sample size of 27 NGOs allowed for a detailed examination of each participating NGO, providing an understanding of their unique contexts, challenges, and practices. This depth of analysis can yield nuanced insights that may be obscured in larger samples. These organizations have been selected because they embody the diversity of Geneva NGOs: some conduct their activities in Geneva whilst others operate across the world. Some are small and under-financed, others are well established. They operate in sectors including healthcare, justice, human rights, peace and education and humanitarian relief. Together, these NGOs bring vital aid and services to tens of millions of beneficiaries.\\n\\nIf you are an NGO looking for help with your cybersecurity, we encourage you to reach out to us. We are here to support and protect your vital work in our increasingly digital world.\\n\\nThe CyberPeace Institute is an independent and neutral non- governmental organisation (NGO) that strives to reduce the frequency, impact, and scale of cyberattacks, to hold actors accountable for the harm they cause, and to assist vulnerable communities.\\n\\nThe Institute is based in Geneva, works in close collaboration with relevant partners to reduce the harm from cyberattacks on people’s lives worldwide, and provide assistance. By analysing cyberattacks, it exposes their societal impact, the ways that international laws and norms are being violated, and advances responsible behaviour to enforce cyberpeace.', metadata={'id': '5_5_CyberPeace_Report.pdf_6', 'type': 'text', 'filename': '5_CyberPeace_Report.pdf', 'page_number': 6}), Document(page_content='Limitations\\n\\nThis report highlights the range of threats NGOs are facing in International Geneva, but does not aim to serve as a comprehensive guide for the issues discussed. Our analysis did not include questions in relation to the NGOs understanding of the legal and regulatory environment in Switzerland and/or the countries they operate in, which although of importance was not the focus. For example, data protection regulations are key considerations for NGOs managing data which must be respected, with reporting obligations in the event of data breaches.\\n\\nThe report purposefully omits detailed information regarding the NGOs that took part in this project. The analysis involved organisations disclosing sensitive information about their vulnerabilities and threat profiles. As such, this precaution is taken to protect the privacy and safety of all the organisations.\\n\\nThis report is not exhaustive and acknowledges that there are other threats, vulnerabilities and actors that come into play from those mentioned herein. There is little available analysis focused on the cyber threat and cybersecurity capacities specific to NGOs. A significant proportion of the analysis currently available is focused on threat actors and their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) with very limited information on victims, targets and the societal impact of attacks. This report advocates systematic and standardized collection, analysis and sharing of information to provide better responses and facilitate international collaboration.\\n\\nThe CyberPeace Institute welcomes any feedback to develop this knowledge product.

Overview\\n\\nAn NGO based in Geneva that provides services to other local and international associations faced a ransomware attack in the winter of 2020, which resulted in over a week's worth of operational data being lost. This case study delves into the details of what happened during the attack, the organization's response, the impact on its operations, lessons learned, and recommendations for future cybersecurity preparedness.\\n\\n2. What happened?\\n\\nIn January 2020, a staff member was checking their emails and accidentally opened a PDF file containing malware, leading to the complete encryption of their data, by a threat actor. The perpetrators used a generic email with the PDF in attachment to launch the attack. The NGO does not believe it was specifically targeted by the attackers. The infection initially started on one workstation and subsequently spread to the organization’s server. The server stored crucial data, including booking information, financial and accounting data, and personal data of staff members. The attackers demanded a considerable sum of money, in bitcoin, for the decryption of the data. The attack involved a ransomware referred to as REvil (Ransomware Evil). This ransomware was first discovered in April 2019 and has been responsible for numerous high-profile cyberattacks. REvil encrypts files on the victim's computer or network, making them inaccessible, and REVIL ransomware operators demand a ransom payment from their victims in exchange for the decryption key.\\n\\nMalware is a malicious software. These are pieces of code designed to damage, destroy, or subvert computer systems. Malware includes viruses that can replicate and stop systems from working.\\n\\n35\\n\\nCyberPeace Analytical Report\\n\\nRansomware is a type of malware designed to extort money by encrypting/blocking access to files or the computer system until a ransom is paid.\\n\\nThe NGO had never previously dealt with a cybersecurity incident like this. At a personal level, the employee who opened the link was both alarmed by what had happened and also angry about being deceived. As described by the Director of the NGO, “My colleagues got scared when confronted with this. The colleague who opened the email containing the malware started to feel guilty. We all did our best to reassure them. But there was this feeling of vulnerability, of being exposed.” All colleagues and management were supportive, promoting a strong “no blame” culture.\\n\\nWhat is a ransomware attack?\\n\\nA ransomware attack is a type of malicious cyberattack in which a perpetrator encrypts a victim's data or files, rendering them inaccessible, and then demands a ransom payment from the victim in exchange for a decryption key or a promise to restore access to the data.\\n\\n■ Ransomware typically gains access to a victim's computer or network through various means, such as malicious email attachments, infected software downloads, or exploited vulnerabilities in software or systems.\\n\\n■ Once the ransomware infiltrates the victim's system, it begins encrypting files, making them unreadable without a decryption key. This encryption process can affect a wide range of files, including documents, images, databases, and more.\\n\\n■ After encrypting the victim's files, the attacker displays a ransom note on the victim's screen or leaves a text file with instructions on how to pay the ransom. The note typically includes the ransom amount, the cryptocurrency (e.g. Bitcoin), wallet address for payment, and a deadline for payment.\", metadata={'id': '21_5_CyberPeace_Report.pdf_35', 'type': 'text', 'filename': '5_CyberPeace_Report.pdf', 'page_number': 35}), Document(page_content=\"5. Lessons Learned\\n\\nSome of the key lessons learned by this NGO after this incident include:\\n\\ni. Training and awareness: Regular cybersecurity training and awareness programs for employees are essential to protect against future attacks.\\n\\nii. Data backup and recovery: Ensuring proper data backup and recovery procedures are in place are crucial to safeguard against data loss during an attack.\\n\\niii. Cybersecurity insurance: Investing in cybersecurity insurance can help mitigate financial losses in the event of a cyberattack.\\n\\n38\\n\\nes\\n\\nCyberPeace Institute | 2023\\n\\nCase Study #2: Attack on an NGO website\\n\\n1. Overview\\n\\nThis case study is about a small NGO based in Geneva whose mission is to provide professional and independent services to assist humanitarian and development organizations in their work. The organization’s website serves as a central platform for communication with partners and clients.\\n\\nIn early 2020, this NGO experienced a cyberattack resulting in the compromise of their website, causing significant disruption to their operations. This case study explores the details of the attack, the organization's response, the impact on their operations, lessons learned, and recommendations.\\n\\n2. What happened?\\n\\nIn early 2020, the organization fell victim to a website attack. When trying to connect to the website, they discovered that they were automatically redirected to a Chinese language marketplace website. The exact timing of the attack remains uncertain, as it was discovered during a period of reduced monitoring.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the organization did not have a backup of their website, requiring a full reconstruction of the site which took nine months to complete. While the organization does not believe that they were deliberately targeted by the cyberattack, it appears the attackers were aiming to generate traffic to the marketplace website. The identity of the threat actor remains unknown, and there is no attribution or evidence linking any individual or group to the attack.\\n\\nWhat is a website attack?\\n\\nA website attack refers to a malicious activity or series of actions aimed at compromising the security, functionality, or availability of a website or web application. These attacks target vulnerabilities in websites to gain unauthorized access, steal data, deface web pages, disrupt services, or carry out other malicious activities. Website attacks are typically orchestrated by cybercriminals, hackers, or other threat actors.\\n\\n39\\n\\nCyberPeace Analytical Report\\n\\nThere are different types of website attacks. Some of the most common ones include:\\n\\n■ SQL Injection (SQLi): In an SQL Injection attack, an attacker injects malicious SQL queries into input fields on a website.\\n\\n■ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.\\n\\n■ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): In CSRF attacks, attackers trick users into unknowingly executing actions on a website without their consent.\\n\\n■ Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): DDoS attacks flood a website's server with a massive volume of traffic, overwhelming its resources and causing it to cease functioning normally or to become unavailable to legitimate users. It is said to be distributed when the source of the attack is composed of a multitude of devices or systems.\\n\\n■ Website Defacement: The illicit or unauthorized modification of the appearance and content of a target’s website or the act of redirecting traffic to other web pages.\", metadata={'id': '23_5_CyberPeace_Report.pdf_38', 'type': 'text', 'filename': '5_CyberPeace_Report.pdf', 'page_number': 38})]\n"
