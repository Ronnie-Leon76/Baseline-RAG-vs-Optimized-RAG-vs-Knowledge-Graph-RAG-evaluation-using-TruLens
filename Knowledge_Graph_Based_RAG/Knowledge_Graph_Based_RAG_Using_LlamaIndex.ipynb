We are heavily inter-\\nconnected and networked, a fact that enhances our quality of life, but\\nalso creates vulnerabilities. From commercial supply chains to the critical\\ninfrastructure that underpins our economy and our society, the risks in the\\ncyber world have multiplied, accelerated, and grown increasingly malicious.\\n\\n\\nMajor corporations, industries and our international allies and partners                           THE HONOURABLE RALPH GOODALE\\nare engaged in the global cyber challenge. But many others are not —\\n                                                                                                   Minister of Public Safety and Emergency\\nrepresenting a significant risk, but also a missed opportunity in this                             Preparedness Canada\\nrapidly growing global industry. While it is important to be keenly aware\\nof cyber threats, Canada’s cyber security policy cannot be driven by fear\\nand defensiveness.\\n\\n\\nWith this in mind, the renewal of the existing Cyber Security Strategy has\\nbeen undertaken with an emphasis on the enormous potential of Canada’s\\nincreased leadership in this field. In partnership with the Ministers of\\nDefence, Innovation, Infrastructure, Public Services and the Treasury\\nBoard, we consulted directly with Canadians and key stakeholders about\\nhow the new strategy could best serve their security needs, while allowing\\nthem to benefit from the opportunities that the digital economy offers.\\nInformed by over 2,000 submissions to our public consultation, the Strategy\\ndirectly addresses the gaps and areas for improvement in Canada’s current\\ncyber security climate.\\n\\n\\nThe Strategy’s core goals are reflected in Budget 2018’s substantial\\ninvestments in cyber security – totaling more than $500 million dollars\\nover five years. As the largest single investment in cyber security ever made\\nby the Canadian government, Budget 2018 demonstrates our commitment\\nto safety and security in the digital age.\\n\\n\\n                                                     ii of iii • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY\\n---\\nAmong the new measures introduced:\\n\\n\\n  •   Funding for the new Canadian Centre for Cyber Security to support\\n      leadership and collaboration between different levels of government and\\n      international partners, while providing a clear and trusted resource for\\n      Canadian citizens and businesses.\\n\\n\\n  •   The creation of the National Cybercrime Coordination Unit to expand the\\n      RCMP’s capacity to investigate cybercrime, establishing a coordination hub\\n      for both domestic and international partners.\\n\\n\\n  •   Funding to foster innovation and economic growth, and the development\\n      of Canadian cyber talent.\\n\\n\\nThe Strategy is the roadmap for Canada’s path forward on cyber security,\\nand is designed to meet the objectives and priorities of Canadians.

They steal personal and financial information,\\nintellectual property, and trade secrets. They disrupt and sometimes destroy\\nthe infrastructure that we rely on for essential services and our way of life.\\n\\n\\nIn 2010, the Government of Canada launched a national effort to defend\\nagainst these threats with Canada’s first Cyber Security Strategy. The\\nprogress made and accomplishments achieved under the 2010 Strategy are\\nthe basis for future action.\\n\\n\\nOur new approach reflects the extent to which digital technologies have\\nbecome essential to our way of life.

Securing Government systems\\n       The Government of Canada increased its capacity to prevent, detect,\\n       respond to, and recover from cyber attacks. The number of data\\n       breaches has steadily declined since 2010 — despite an increase in the\\n       number and sophistication of state-sponsored and non-state cyber\\n       activities against Government networks.\\n\\n\\nII.    Partnering to secure vital cyber systems outside\\n       the federal government\\n\\n\\n       Partnerships were forged with owners and operators of Canada’s\\n       critical infrastructure, the private sector, and provincial and territorial\\n       governments. The Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre (CCIRC)\\n       expanded its operations, with over 1300 organizations receiving regular\\n       alerts and communications.\\n\\n\\nIII.   Helping Canadians to be secure online\\n\\n\\n       Through the Get Cyber Safe campaign, the Government of Canada\\n       supported cyber security awareness with outreach, activities, and\\n       development of targeted resources. Efforts made under the 2010 Strategy\\n       also improved the capacity of the RCMP and law enforcement agencies\\n       to combat cybercrime, including initial investments in cybercrime\\n       intelligence, investigations, and training.\\n\\n\\n                                                 6 of 35 • NATiONAL CYBER SECURiTY STRATEGY\\n---\\nIntroduction\\n\\n\\nBuilding on Canada’s Accomplishments in a\\nDynamic Cyber Landscape\\n\\n\\nWhat is Cyber Security?\\nCyber security is the protection of digital information and the\\ninfrastructure on which it resides.\\n\\n\\nCyber security was once the domain of technical experts, but now, in our\\n\\n\\ndigital world, we all have a role to play in our individual and collective\\ncyber security.\\n\\n\\nFrom the Margins to the Mainstream\\n\\n\\nThe degree to which digital technology is now integrated into our daily\\nlives would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.

For instance,\\ninternet-connected technologies are increasingly popular, from thermostats\\nand healthcare devices like pacemakers to cars and the systems that run\\n\\nour critical infrastructure and services. Without adequate cyber security,\\nconnected devices are vulnerable to being hacked on an unprecedented\\nscale. Similarly, many Canadians rely on encryption to secure their online\\ncommunications and data.

An admin-only form builder which facilitates building user interfaces\\n         (e.g., select questions to be displayed in a maternal-and-child-health\\n         registration process)\\n     2. User interfaces (i.e., forms) which can be used in lieu of individual end-\\n         user apps building their own forms (e.g. I’m building a new maternal and\\n         child health application; I’d like to use a registration screen flow that’s\\n         been pre-built in the registration building block as part of a larger,\\n         composed application.)\\n     3. A public API which exposes the critical back-end services performed by\\n         this BB (adding a mom to a database; checking for a mom’s enrollment\\n         status in a program) to be used (as a microservice) by existing or new\\n         applications with legacy/bespoke needs (e.g., i’ve already got a maternal\\n         and child health app that the CHWs are using, and I want to send a\\n         webhook to the registration BB after a CHW clicks “submit” on our custom\\n         form.)\\n2.4 Cross-Building Block Communication\\nA building block is only so useful on its own. In practice, building blocks MUST be\\nconnected together in a secure, robust, trusted manner that facilitates\\ndistributed deployments and communications with existing services.\\nIt is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that a building block use an information mediator\\n(as described below and in the Information Mediator Building Block specification)\\nfor any communications across the internet. An Information Mediator is not\\nrequired for communication between building blocks which are co-located. In this\\ncase, communication may occur using standard API calls.\\n2.4.1 Federation and Data Exchange Requirements\\nEach building block deployment SHOULD use an Information Mediator to federate\\nand communicate with other data consumers and providers, particularly when\\ncommunicating between services that are not co-located. This ensures the\\nconfidentiality, integrity, and interoperability between data exchange parties. An\\nInformation Mediator MUST provide the following capabilities:\\n\\n\\n         address management\\n\\n\\n         message routing\\n\\n\\n         access rights management\\n\\n\\n         organization-level authentication\\n\\n\\n         machine-level authentication\\n\\n\\n         transport-level encryption\\n\\n\\n         time-stamping\\n\\n\\n         digital signature of messages\\n\\n\\n                                                                                      5\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\n        logging\\n\\n\\n        error handling\\n\\n\\n        monitoring and alerting\\n\\n\\n        service registry and discovery\\nRefer to the full description of the Information Mediator Building Block for more\\ninformation.\\n2.4.2 Organizational Model\\nIn order to effectively deploy a software solution using the Information Mediator,\\nseveral policies and processes will need to be applied. This section briefly\\ndescribes that organizational processes that must be in place.\\nFirst, a central operator will be identified and created. This organization will be\\nresponsible for the overall operation of the system, including operations and\\nonboarding new members. Policies and contractual agreements for onboarding\\nneed to be created.\\nTrust services need to be set up internally or procured from third parties,\\nincluding timestamp and certificate authorities. This provides the necessary\\ninfrastructure to support distributed deployments.\\nFinally, members can be onboarded and provided with access to the Information\\nMediator and methods to register the services that they provide as well as\\ndiscover services that are available.\\nOnce agreements are in place, members can deploy new services in a\\ndecentralized, distributed manner. Before deploying a new service, the central\\noperator must be notified of any changes to access-rights, including organization\\nand machine-level authentication before it can publish or consume data.\\n2.4.3 Technical Architecture\\nThis section provides an overview of the technical processes and architecture\\nthat must be implemented once the organizational model has been created.\\n    1. A Central Operator is responsible for maintaining a registry of members,\\n        the security policies for building blocks and other member instances, a list\\n        of trusted certification authorities and a list of trusted time-stamping\\n        authorities. The member registry and security policies MUST be exposed to\\n        the Information Mediator.\\n    2. Certificate authorities are responsible for issuing and revoking certificates\\n        used for securing and ensuring the integrity of federated information\\n        systems. Certificate authorities MUST support the Online Certificate Status\\n        Protocol (OCSP) so that an Information Mediator can check certificate\\n        validity.\\n    3. Time-stamping authorities securely facilitate time stamping of messages.\\n        Time stamping authorities MUST support batched time stamping.\\n    4. The Service Registry provides a mechanism for building blocks to register\\n        the services that they provide and for other building blocks to discover\\n\\n\\n                                                                                      6\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\n        and consume those services. Any services provided or consumed by a\\n        Building Block that leverages the Information Mediator architecture MUST\\n        use this service registry functionality.\\n2.5 Keywords and Definitions\\nWithin this document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",\\n\"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT\\nRECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as described in\\nBCP 14 RFC2119 RFC8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as\\nshown here.\\n2.5.1 Building Block-specific definitions\\nThe following provides definitions for terms that are used by various building\\nblocks.\\nRegistration: Any approval/license/certificate issued by a public entity as a\\nresult of a request/declaration made by a user of the public service. The result of\\na “registration” is usually a number and/or a document (called certificate,\\nlicense, permit, authorization, registration, clearance, approval, etc.)\\nAuthentication: This is the technical process of establishing that the credentials\\n(i.e. username, password, biometric etc.) provided by a party (user, system,\\nother) is valid and that the party can be granted basic access to system\\nresources with default access rights. Note that authorization also needs to be\\napplied for a party to access protected resources.\\nAuthorization: This is the technical process of establishing whether or not an\\nauthenticated party has rights to access a given protected resource. Access\\nrights can typically be granted or revoked administratively on a read-only and/or\\nread-write and/or execute basis through an administrative provisioning process.\\nPermissions or rights defined for a party typically manifest in an access token\\nthat is granted at the time of authentication for the party. Hence the processes of\\nauthentication and authorization are intrinsically related.\\nWorkflow Terminology: See more comprehensive descriptions of the workflow\\nterminology in the Workflow and Business Process Automation Building Block\\nspecification.\\n\\n\\n        (Workflow) Activity - a single step in a workflow process.\\n\\n\\n        (Workflow) Process - a workflow process contains one or many activities.\\n\\n\\n        (Workflow) Instance - an instance of execution for a workflow process.\\n3 Considerations\\nAs with any software implementation, there are constraints and limitations in the\\nGovStack approach that must be addressed. In any country context, there will be\\ndeficiencies that present challenges to any technology implementation.

A Citizen-centric technology will include the following attributes:\\n\\n\\n                                                                                           9\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\n        User-centered design\\n\\n\\n        Right to be forgotten: everything must be deletable\\nThe best tools evolve from empathizing, understanding and designing for the\\nneeds of end-users. Accordingly, we’ve identified a series of use cases and user\\njourneys here: GovStack Use Cases\\nEach use case is composed of a collection of modules, or building blocks. As you\\ncan see, a relatively small set of these building blocks can be readily applied to a\\nwide variety of applications in low-resource settings.\\n4.2 Open\\nWhere possible, GovStack advocates for the use of open technology, which can\\nreduce cost and help avoid vendor lock-in. Open technology can be defined as:\\n\\n\\n        Based on open standards\\n\\n\\n        Based on Digital Development Principles, see https://digitalprinciples.org/\\n        and https://digitalinvestmentprinciples.org/\\n\\n\\n        Built on open-source software where possible\\n\\n\\n        Supports open development, see https://standard.publiccode.net/\\n\\n\\n        Cloud native where possible (Docker/Docker Compose/OCI containers)\\n4.3 Sustainable\\nAny Building Blocks should be developed in a manner which is sustainable and\\nensures that the technology will continue to be updated and maintained. Some\\ncore considerations for sustainability are:\\n\\n\\n        Stewardship is critical, see https://publiccode.net/codebase-stewardship/\\n\\n\\n        Continuous funding for maintenance, development and evolution\\n\\n\\n        Attractive to ICT industry and individual developers in deployment\\n        environment (incentives must be aligned)\\n\\n\\n        Lower cost than commercial solutions due to shared development costs\\n\\n\\n        Uses microservices-based architecture instead of monolithic.\\n            o This increases interoperability, development and deployment speed\\n                 and reliability.\\n            o From Wikipedia: a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA)\\n                 structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely\\n                 coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-\\n                 grained and the protocols are lightweight.\\n4.4 Secure\\nWith any technology deployment, security is paramount. Detailed security\\nrequirements are defined in the GovStack Security Requirements. Beyond those\\nstandards, Building Blocks should have the following attributes:\\n\\n\\n                                                                                        10\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\n        Building Blocks are audited and certified before being made available\\n\\n\\n        Development processes and standards enforce quality and security\\n\\n\\n        Different certification levels reflect level of standards-compliance\\n\\n\\n        Regular security scanning and auditing\\n\\n\\n        Public ratings and reviews\\n\\n\\n        Comprehensive logging and exception handling\\n4.5 Accessible\\nIt is vitally important that technology solutions be usable by all. Some\\ncharacteristics of accessible design include:\\n\\n\\n        Meets users where they are: web, mobile, SMS and/or voice. UI supports\\n        accessibility technologies, e.g. screen readers.\\n\\n\\n        SSO allows for signing in once for multiple services\\n\\n\\n        Shared ownership of code\\n\\n\\n        Deployment and development processes and standards are open to\\n        contributors\\n\\n\\n        Community-driven development tools for documentation and support\\n\\n\\n        Blueprints, templates and documentation\\n4.6 Flexible\\nGovStack is rooted in the concept that Building Blocks should be re-usable and\\nconfigurable, such that they can support multiple use cases with minimal effort:\\n\\n\\n        Building Blocks can be reused in multiple contexts\\n\\n\\n        Each Building Block is autonomous\\n\\n\\n        Building Blocks are interoperable, adhering to shared standards\\n\\n\\n        Building Blocks should be easy to set up\\n\\n\\n        Standardized configuration and communications protocols should be used\\n        to connecting Building Blocks\\n\\n\\n        Building Blocks can be provided as a service (ICT opportunity)\\n4.7 Robust\\nDeployments of Building Blocks should follow these principles:\\n\\n\\n        Any client-facing functionality should operate in low-resource\\n        environments:\\n            o Occasional power\\n            o Low bandwidth\\n            o Low-reliability connectivity\\n\\n\\n                                                                                  11\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\n         Easily scalable for high availability and reliability\\n\\n\\n         API-only based decoupling\\n\\n\\n         Asynchronous communications pattern decoupled through rooms is ideal\\n\\n\\n         Eventual consistency for data\\n\\n\\n5 Cross-Cutting Requirements\\nBuilding blocks are responsible for meeting all cross-cutting requirements or\\nspecifying why specific requirements do not apply. Govstack compliance and\\ncertification processes will validate these requirements.\\n5.1 Follow TM Forum Specification REST API Design Guidelines Part 1\\n(REQUIRED)\\nSee: TM Forum REST API Design Guidelines\\nSome key principles from these design guidelines are as follows:\\n\\n\\n         APIs MUST not include Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or session\\n         keys in URLs - use POST or other methods for this\\n\\n\\n         MUST support caching/retries\\n\\n\\n         Resource identification in requests Individual resources are identified in\\n         requests, for example using URIs in RESTful Web services. The resources\\n         themselves are conceptually separate from the representations that are\\n         returned to the client. For example, the server could send data from its\\n         database as HTML, XML or as JSON—none of which are the server\\'s\\n         internal representation.\\n\\n\\n         Resource manipulation through representations. When a client holds a\\n         representation of a resource, including any metadata attached, it has\\n         enough information to modify or delete the resource\\'s state.\\n\\n\\n         Self-descriptive messages Each message includes enough information to\\n         describe how to process the message. For example, which parser to invoke\\n         can be specified by a media type.\\n5.2 Follow TM Forum Specification REST API Design Guidelines Parts 2-7\\n(RECOMMENDED)\\nSee: TM Forum REST API Design Guidelines\\n5.3 Communicate with other BBs only via API (REQUIRED)\\nParaphrased from the Amazon API Mandate: https://api-university.com/blog/the-\\napi-mandate/\\n    1. All BBs must expose their data and functionality through service interfaces\\n         (APIs).\\n    2. Building Blocks communicate with each other through these interfaces.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                     12\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\n    3. There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no\\n        direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-\\n        memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication\\n        allowed is via service interface calls over the network.\\n    4. It doesn’t matter what technology is used. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom\\n        protocols — doesn’t matter.\\n    5. All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the\\n        ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and\\n        design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside\\n        world. No exceptions.\\nBuilding blocks MUST NOT use shared databases, file systems or memory for\\ndata exchange with other building blocks.\\n5.4 APIs must be Versioned (REQUIRED)\\nUse semantic versioning when documenting changes to API definitions. Any\\nbreaking changes to APIs MUST use a different endpoint, as shown here: e.g.\\n/api/v1 and /api/v2\\nSee https://semver.org/\\n5.5 Documentation must be Provided (REQUIRED)\\nDocumentation on the installation and use of the Building Block MUST be\\nprovided. Where possible, this documentation SHOULD be stored alongside code\\nin a repository. Documentation MAY be generated from code where applicable.\\n5.6 Provide an OpenAPI specification (REQUIRED)\\nEach building block’s service APIs MUST be defined and exposed using a\\nstandardized machine-readable language. External APIs are described using the\\nOpenAPI 3.x specification. See the following resources for additional information:\\n\\n\\n        Definition of the OpenAPI standard\\n\\n\\n        Swagger OpenAPI 3.0 Specification\\n5.7 Building blocks must be deployable as a container (REQUIRED)\\n\\n\\n        Each building block MUST be ready to be deployed as independent\\n        container images. Source code and build instructions SHOULD be\\n        committed to a public code repository where possible.\\n\\n\\n        A building block may be composed with Kubernetes or docker compose. All\\n        build files must be included alongside the source code.\\n5.8 Include all deployment scripts (RECOMMENDED)\\nWhen a building block requires deployment tools such as Kubernetes or Ansible,\\nconfiguration and deployment scripts should be included in the building block\\nrepository. Use of this type of deployment configuration will make individual\\ncomponents of the building block independently scalable and make building\\nblocks less monolithic and more efficient.\\n5.9 Comply with GDPR Principles (REQUIRED)\\n\\n\\n                                                                                    13\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\nBuilding Blocks MUST conform to GDPR principles, including the right to be\\nforgotten account deletion, and privacy requirements to protect the rights of\\nindividuals. Note that these requirements may vary by region, and building\\nblocks must conform to regulatory requirements wherever they are deployed.\\n5.10 Include Support for Capturing Logging information (REQUIRED)\\nBuilding Blocks MUST have a mechanism for generating logging information. This\\nmay be as simple as using STDOUT and capturing through docker logs, or may\\nuse other log sinking technologies.\\n5.11 Use Web Hooks for Callbacks (REQUIRED)\\nWhen Building Blocks require callback functionality, they must use webhooks and\\nnot direct links to functions within the building block.\\n5.12 Enforce Transport Security (REQUIRED)\\nAll Building Blocks MUST support secure HTTPS transport with TLS 1.3 and\\ninsecure cyphers disabled.\\n5.13 GET and PUT APIs must be Idempotent (REQUIRED)\\nGET and PUT APIs (as well as HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE) must be idempotent,\\nreturning the same value if called multiple times. POST and DELETE APIs will not\\nbe idempotent as they change the underlying data. Reference\\nhttps://restfulapi.net/idempotent-rest-apis/ for more information.\\n5.14 Use Stateless APIs wherever Possible to Enhance Scalability\\n(RECOMMENDED)\\nAPI calls SHOULD be able to be made independently of one another. Each API call\\nshould contains all of the data necessary to complete itself successfully.\\n5.15 Include Transaction/Trace/Correlation IDs (RECOMMENDED)\\nTransactions that cross multiple services SHOULD provide a correlation ID that is\\npassed with every request and response. This allows for easier tracing and\\ntracking of a specific transaction.\\n5.16 Include Clearly-Defined Key Rotation Policies (RECOMMENDED)\\nSome blocks may require the use of security keys. Those that do must have\\nclearly defined key rotation policies to enhance security\\n5.17 Databases should not Include Business Logic (RECOMMENDED)\\nDatabase processing tools like triggers and stored procedures should be avoided.\\n5.18 Use only Unicode for Text (REQUIRED)\\n5.19 Use ISO8601/UTC for Timestamps (REQUIRED)\\n5.20 Building Blocks must be Autonomous (REQUIRED)\\nEach building block MUST be capable of running independently, without requiring\\nother dependencies such as external data stores or other building blocks.\\n5.21 Use Secure Configuration (REQUIRED)\\n\\n\\n                                                                                   14\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\nConfiguration MUST be done using secure processes, such as environment\\nvariables or a secure secret store.\\n5.22 Design for Asynchronous First (RECOMMENDED)\\nDesigns should support occasional connectivity/low bandwidth, and should allow\\nfor asynchronous communication between building blocks. A Publish/Subscribe\\ndesign pattern can be used to handle changes, allowing loosely-coupled solutions\\nto be assembled without changing existing APIs.\\n5.23 Use Standardized Data Formats for Interchange (REQUIRED)\\nJSON SHOULD be used for data models/services wherever possible. See\\nhttps://www.json.org/json-en.html. Where JSON exhange is not possible, building\\nblocks must use other standard data formats (such as XML).\\n5.24 Use Existing Standards for Data Interchange, Where Available\\n(RECOMMENDED)\\nIf an existing standard is available, it should be used, e.g. DICOM/Hl7/FHIR for\\nhealthcare. TMForum has a large library of standardized APIs and data models\\nthat can be used.\\nBuilding blocks and building block solutions MUST leverage existing standards,\\nespecially those listed in the Standards section below.\\n5.25 Use I/O Sanitization (RECOMMENDED)\\nBuilding blocks SHOULD validate all incoming data to ensure that it conforms\\nwith the expected format and type. APIs should also sanitize incoming data,\\nremoving any unsafe characters or tokens.\\n5.26 Provide a Compliance Test Mock/Example Implementation\\n(OPTIONAL)\\nA building block MAY provide a mock testing implementation of API functionality\\nto show example endpoints and data payloads.

For organisations that process Personal Data, it provides the\\nability to know the individual\\'s will and legitimately process such Personal Data.\\nThe Consent Building Block is a process-oriented GovStack Building Block\\nfacilitating auditable bilateral agreements within a multi-agent environment that\\nintegrates with most other Building Blocks.\\nThis specification has used several available and recognised open standards\\nbelow and legal frameworks (such as the GDPR) for laying the groundwork for its\\napproach to consent.\\n\\n\\n        Kantara Initiative: Consent Specification\\n\\n\\n        ISO 29184: 2020: Online Privacy Notices and Consent\\n\\n\\n        ISO/IEC 29100:2011: Privacy Framework\\n\\n\\n        ISO/TS 17975:2022: Health informatics — Principles and data requirements\\n        for consent in the Collection, Use or Disclosure of personal health\\n        information\\n\\n\\n        ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023: Privacy technologies — Consent record\\n        information structure\\nWhat Consent Is\\nIn the GovStack context, consent is understood as a voluntary declaration by an\\nindividual to approve the processing of their Personal Data. It is one specific\\njustification for Personal Data processing that is assumed to be required by legal\\nor ethical conditions. It assumes that the person can decide on processing their\\nPersonal Data, managed in and by other GovStack Building Blocks, and also that\\nthe person is free to withdraw their consent at any time.\\nSome examples of such consent are:\\n\\n\\n        allowing a healthcare provider to fetch socio-demographic data from a\\n        government-run population registry to provide adequate primary\\n        healthcare services.\\n\\n\\n        allowing a government official to fetch relevant data from other/multiple\\n        government-run registries to analyse the eligibility for a social benefit\\n        programme.\\n\\n\\n        allow a government official to send Personal Data to a bank for cash\\n        transfers on behalf of the government.\\nWhat Consent Is Not\\nThe use of consent should be avoided in cases as below, which are not part of\\nthis specification:\\n\\n\\n                                                                                    17\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\n        When a person is simply informed of the processing of the data by the\\n        organisation as part of the service provided under contract or by an\\n        authority.\\n\\n\\n        When consent does not have to be obtained in a situation where the entity\\n        does not identify or cannot identify people with reasonable effort.\\n\\n\\nAssumptions\\nLays out the pre-conditions needed for anyone to use the Consent Building Block.\\n    1. Data Disclosure Agreements between organisations are already in place.\\n        For example, a healthcare organisation has already got the required\\n        authorisation to use the citizen data registry.\\n    2. To link a Consent Agreement with the specific Individual, Consent Building\\n        Block assumes the authentication and authorization to be handled in a\\n        trusted manner outside of it (see below).\\n    3. Within the early scope of the Consent Building Block, the act of delegating\\n        is kept outside the scope of the Consent Building Block. It is assumed that\\n        the authorisation to act on behalf of someone else is already resolved.\\n    4. It is the organization\\'s (a Data Provider or a Data Consumer) obligation to\\n        manage and implement internal policies toward its employees relating to\\n        their responsibilities for Personal Data processing integrity, specifying it in\\n        the employment contract or by other means.\\nConsent Agreement Lifecycle\\nThe life cycle of a consent agreement starts and ends within the organisation\\nresponsible for the information system. The organisation knows the context in\\nwhich the information system operates and the intended purpose of the service.\\nThe rules and regulations to be applied for a given level of assurance define the\\nfunctional framework for consent management.\\nConsent Building Block deals with transparency on data usage in a given context.\\nThus privacy-by-design of the system\\'s actors is often an excellent guiding\\nprinciple for interpreting international, national, and organisational policies and\\ngovernance principles to implement the functional consent framework. A\\ntangible outcome from a Data Protection Impact Analysis (DPIA) is a structured\\napproach that can deliver the input for the actual implementation of the Consent\\nBuilding Block.\\nIndividual consent is captured within the context of digital interaction. This\\ninteraction is composite of all the information systems involved, not solely the\\nConsent Building Block. Thus, the legal and ethical boundaries of consent are\\ndefined in the entirety of the interaction. In particular, consent, as defined by\\nISO/TS 17975:2015(E), should be seen as a \"set of agreements and constraints\"\\nthat an informed and knowledgeable [individual] agrees to apply to their data\\nprocessing. This definition, not based on the purpose of the data usage, can lead\\nto a consent management framework also incorporating authorisations or\\nunrelated constraints of the system. For example, in health information and\\n\\n\\n                                                                                         18\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\nhealthcare service delivery, consent is also the process whereby a set of\\nconstraints is agreed upon so that information may be collected and used or\\ndisclosed. However, it is also the outcome of the process. As a rule of thumb,\\nlimiting unintended secondary usage of data is helpful to separate \"consent\" for\\na purpose from \"consent\" as an agreement to constraints and authorisation\\nimposed by the system\\'s functional requirements.\\nAs a result, the organisation responsible for the information system is the driver\\nof the definition of the functional consent management framework. It is also the\\nfunction of the organisation to design the workflow for obtaining and processing\\nthe consent in a way that is purposeful, but not annoying for individuals or data\\nprocessors with unnecessary bureaucratic overhead. From this framework, the\\nConsent Building Block achieves its purpose by employing Consent Agreements\\nthat contain the following:\\n\\n\\n            A data policy that could be reused across multiple consent agreements\\n            (for example, based on the General Data Protection Regulation or any\\n            specific regulation)\\n\\n\\n            The purpose of consent, processed data attributes\\n\\n\\n            Signatures\\nA consent agreement life-cycle has four main phases, as illustrated in the figure\\nbelow:\\n      Legal EntityRegulations                   Organisations                          Individuals              Data Processing AuditorOrganisations\\n         Consent Schema                                                               Consent Agreement                       Consent Receipis\\n                                                                                    Presentaticnindividuals\\n        Definition                              Preparation                              Capture                                 Proof\\n                                                                                           Delegate                                Yenb\\n  Regulations specifies how the      Prepare Consent Agreement based         Organisations capture the Consent    Auditors can verify the Consent\\n  Consent has t0 be defined          on their data usagewith data            Receipts from the Individual         Receipts, e.g-in case of disputes:\\n                                     attributes\\n                                                                                                                   Organisations can check before\\n                                                                                                                  processing any datae.g in\\n                                                                                                                  algorithmic decision making\\nDiagram Source\\nDefinition: In this phase, the organisation (a Data Provider or a Data Consumer)\\nadopts and defines a Data Policy that applies to the industry or sector-specific\\ndata usage as a template.

Its key\\npurpose is to allow individuals to view Consent Agreements and sign or withdraw\\ntheir consent on what Personal Data is used and accessible to organisations. It\\nalso clarifies the Data Policy applied, such as the purpose, retention period,\\njurisdiction, third-party data sharing, etc.\\nThe Consent Building Block implements the key functionalities described in the\\nconsent management lifecycle. It includes the ability to configure consent\\nagreements by an organisation admin, present consent requests towards\\nindividuals, capture consents, enable queries if consent exists, or not, and enable\\nindependent audit of consents.\\nThe functionalities are derived from the consent agreement lifecycle and\\ncategorised according to the Actors described above. While the consenting\\nworkflows (as described above) are implicitly considered the centrepiece of the\\nConsent Building Block, it is important to realise that the integrity of consent\\nmanagement can only be achieved if robust configuration before and auditing\\nafter the Consent Agreement signing and Consent Record verification activities\\nare in place. Hence, the functionalities are described following the logical\\nsequence of the consent agreement lifecycle and they are all equally important\\ncomponents of the Consent Building Block.\\nThe Consent process (creating and signing Consent Agreements and Consent\\nRecords) is initially managed in the application provided by the Organisation that\\nis legally required to collect the consent. Since it can be either a Data Consuming\\norganisation or a Data Providing organisation, the Consent Building Block allows\\nboth to be able to verify their conformance with the underlying Data Policy, both\\norganisations must be able to access and use the application.\\nWhile the Actors generally fall in line with the categories of the functionalities, it\\nis important to realise that “auditing” functions in the narrow sense, verifying if\\n\\n\\n                                                                                         22\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\ndata processing is being (or has been) processed according to the Data Policy\\nrequiring a consent, is relevant to various entities involved in the data\\nprocessing.

The auditor role\\nwill most probably be akin to a Data Protection Officer (DPO), possibly from an\\nexternal third-party organisation and involve activities outside of the Consent\\nBuilding Block.\\nTo avoid ambiguity, we use the precise term Data Processing Auditor to stress\\nthe specificity of tasks to be performed by and for the Consent Building Block; all\\nother actions not within the Consent Building Block\\'s scope are considered as an\\nexternal prerequisite and as a “black box” activity. With respect to audit, this role\\nis distinguished from the data policy auditor. The Data Processing Auditor relies\\non an audit universe defined by the control and risk management of the specific\\nproject and context (i.e. outside the Consent Building Block). “Who needs to\\nconsent to what” is the outcome of a DPIA (Data Protection Impact Analysis),\\nensuring that the data policies are compliant with the relevant data protection\\nregulations for the project.\\nThe main actions a Data Processing Auditor (or Data Protection Officer, DPO) is\\nexpected to perform via Consent Building Block are:\\n\\n\\n        auditing tracking the consents (opt-in/opt-out);\\n\\n\\n        auditing tracking Data Policy changes and configuration conformance with\\n        it;\\n\\n\\n        viewing (reading, exporting) the Consent Agreements and relevant reports\\n        in a verifiable form.\\nFor the implementation of a specific use case, it is important to distinguish the\\nData Processing Auditor, an actor described here, from a data policy auditor, an\\nactor of the risk organisation. It is expected that the two roles are coordinated in\\nthe risk management process. Within the Consent Building Block, the Data\\nProcessing Auditor performs the tasks that will allow a data policy auditor to\\nconfirm that the implemented system complies with existing regulations\\ndemanding consent.The table below summarises the key use cases identified for\\nthe Data Processing Auditor.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                25\\n---\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\nAlso to consider: “READ CONSENT STATUS” use-case is also used by any\\nworkflow (and Actor) that requires verification of the consent status (for example,\\nbefore executing the data transfer from Data Providing System to the Data\\nConsuming System).\\n\\n\\nConsent use-cases                                                                        Link to\\n                                                                                         the UCS\\n\\n\\nAUDIT CONSENT - Query the Consents related to individuals or                             UC-C-PIC-\\npolicies (opt-in/opt-opt)                                                                AT-001\\n\\n\\nMONITOR POLICY UPDATE- Tracking Data Policy changes and                                  UC-C-PIC-\\nconfiguration conformance with it;                                                       AT-002\\n\\n\\nREAD CONSENT STATUS - Viewing (reading, exporting) the Consent                           UC-C-PIC-\\nAgreements and relevant reports in a verifiable form                                     AT-003\\n\\n\\nVERIFY CONSENT INTEGRITY - Ability to check the integrity of the                         UC-C-PIC-\\nsigned agreements                                                                        AT-004\\n\\n\\nScenarios: Consent and Data Access\\nAs described above under Universal Consenting Workflows, there may be an\\nunlimited number of business processes that require consent.

Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is the first treaty\\nnegotiated under the auspices of the World Health Organization. The WHO FCTC is an\\nevidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health.\\nThe WHO FCTC represents a paradigm shift in developing a regulatory strategy to address\\naddictive substances; in contrast to previous drug control treaties, the WHO FCTC asserts the\\nimportance of demand reduction strategies as well as supply issues.\\n\\n\\n     The WHO FCTC was developed in response to the globalization of the tobacco epidemic.\\nThe spread of the tobacco epidemic is facilitated through a variety of complex factors with\\ncross-border effects, including trade liberalization and direct foreign investment. Other factors\\nsuch as global marketing, transnational tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and\\nthe international movement of contraband and counterfeit cigarettes have also contributed to\\nthe explosive increase in tobacco use.\\n\\n\\n     From the first preambular paragraph, which states that the “Parties to this Convention\\n[are] determined to give priority to their right to protect public health”, the WHO FCTC is a\\nglobal trend-setter.\\n\\n\\n     The core demand reduction provisions in the WHO FCTC are contained in articles 6-14:\\n\\n\\n     Price and tax measures to reduce the demand for tobacco, and\\n\\n\\n     Non-price measures to reduce the demand for tobacco, namely:\\n\\n\\n     \\x83     Protection from exposure to tobacco smoke;\\n     \\x83     Regulation of the contents of tobacco products;\\n     \\x83     Regulation of tobacco product disclosures;\\n     \\x83     Packaging and labelling of tobacco products;\\n     \\x83     Education, communication, training and public awareness;\\n     \\x83     Tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; and,\\n     \\x83     Demand reduction measures concerning tobacco dependence and cessation.\\n\\n\\n     The core supply reduction provisions in the WHO FCTC are contained in articles 15-17:\\n\\n\\n     Illicit trade in tobacco products;\\n     Sales to and by minors; and,\\n     Provision of support for economically viable alternative activities.\\n\\n\\n     Another novel feature of the Convention is the inclusion of a provision that addresses\\nliability. Mechanisms for scientific and technical cooperation and exchange of information are\\nset out in Articles 20-22.\\n\\n\\n                                                          v\\n---\\n                           WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\n      The WHO FCTC opened for signature on 16 June to 22 June 2003 in Geneva, and\\nthereafter at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Depositary of the treaty, from\\n30 June 2003 to 29 June 2004. The treaty, which is now closed for signature, has 168\\nSignatories, including the European Community, which makes it one of the most widely\\nembraced treaties in UN history. Member States that have signed the Convention indicate that\\nthey will strive in good faith to ratify, accept, or approve it, and show political commitment not\\nto undermine the objectives set out in it. Countries wishing to become a Party, but that did not\\nsign the Convention by 29 June 2004, may do so by means of accession, which is a one-step\\nprocess equivalent to ratification.\\n\\n\\n      The Convention entered into force on 27 February 2005 -- 90 days after it has been\\nacceded to, ratified, accepted, or approved by 40 States.                    Beginning on that date, the forty\\nContracting Parties are legally bound by the treaty\\'s provisions. For each State that ratifies,\\naccepts or approves the Convention or accedes thereto after the conditions set out in paragraph\\n1 of Article 36 for entry into force have been fulfilled, the Convention shall enter into force on\\nthe ninetieth day following the date of deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance,\\napproval or accession. For regional economic integration organizations, the Convention enters\\ninto force on the ninetieth day following the date of deposit of its instrument of formal\\nconfirmation or accession.\\n\\n\\n      The global network developed over the period of the negotiations of the WHO FCTC will\\nbe important in preparing for the implementation of the Convention at country level. In the\\nwords of WHO\\'s Director General, Dr Jong-wook LEE:\\n\\n\\n         \"The WHO FCTC negotiations have already unleashed a process that has\\n         resulted in visible differences at country level. The success of the WHO FCTC\\n         as a tool for public health will depend on the energy and political commitment\\n         that we devote to implementing it in countries in the coming years.                                 A\\n         successful result will be global public health gains for all.\"\\n\\n\\n      For this to materialize, the drive and commitment, which was so evident during the\\nnegotiations, will need to spread to national and local levels so that the WHO FCTC becomes a\\nconcrete reality where it counts most, in countries.\\n\\n\\n                                                           vi\\n---\\n                          WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\nPreamble\\n\\n\\n         The Parties to this Convention,\\n\\n\\n         Determined to give priority to their right to protect public health,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing that the spread of the tobacco epidemic is a global problem with serious\\nconsequences for public health that calls for the widest possible international cooperation and\\nthe participation of all countries in an effective, appropriate and comprehensive international\\nresponse,\\n\\n\\n         Reflecting the concern of the international community about the devastating worldwide\\nhealth, social, economic and environmental consequences of tobacco consumption and\\nexposure to tobacco smoke,\\n\\n\\n         Seriously concerned about the increase in the worldwide consumption and production\\nof cigarettes and other tobacco products, particularly in developing countries, as well as about\\nthe burden this places on families, on the poor, and on national health systems,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing       that scientific evidence has unequivocally established that tobacco\\nconsumption and exposure to tobacco smoke cause death, disease and disability, and that there\\nis a time lag between the exposure to smoking and the other uses of tobacco products and the\\nonset of tobacco-related diseases,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing also that cigarettes and some other products containing tobacco are highly\\nengineered so as to create and maintain dependence, and that many of the compounds they\\ncontain and the smoke they produce are pharmacologically active, toxic, mutagenic and\\ncarcinogenic, and that tobacco dependence is separately classified as a disorder in major\\ninternational classifications of diseases,\\n\\n\\n         Acknowledging that there is clear scientific evidence that prenatal exposure to tobacco\\nsmoke causes adverse health and developmental conditions for children,\\n\\n\\n         Deeply concerned          about the escalation in smoking and other forms of tobacco\\nconsumption by children and adolescents worldwide, particularly smoking at increasingly\\nearly ages,\\n\\n\\n         Alarmed by the increase in smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by women\\nand young girls worldwide and keeping in mind the need for full participation of women at all\\nlevels of policy-making and implementation and the need for gender-specific tobacco control\\nstrategies,\\n\\n\\n                                                           1\\n---\\n                           WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\n         Deeply concerned          about the high levels of smoking and other forms of tobacco\\nconsumption by indigenous peoples,\\n\\n\\n         Seriously concerned          about the impact        of  all forms of advertising, promotion and\\nsponsorship aimed at encouraging the use of tobacco products,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing that cooperative action is necessary to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in\\ncigarettes and other tobacco products, including smuggling, illicit manufacturing and\\ncounterfeiting,\\n\\n\\n         Acknowledging         that tobacco control at all levels and particularly in developing\\ncountries and in countries with economies in transition requires sufficient financial and\\ntechnical resources commensurate with the current and projected need for tobacco control\\nactivities,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing the need to develop appropriate mechanisms to address the long-term\\nsocial and economic implications of successful tobacco demand reduction strategies,\\n\\n\\n         Mindful of the social and economic difficulties that tobacco control programmes may\\nengender in the medium and long term in some developing countries and countries with\\neconomies in transition, and recognizing their need for technical and financial assistance in the\\ncontext of nationally developed strategies for sustainable development,\\n\\n\\n         Conscious of the valuable work being conducted by many States on tobacco control and\\ncommending the leadership of the World Health Organization as well as the efforts of other\\norganizations and bodies of the United Nations system and other international and regional\\nintergovernmental organizations in developing measures on tobacco control,\\n\\n\\n         Emphasizing        the special contribution of nongovernmental organizations and other\\nmembers of civil society not affiliated with the tobacco industry, including health professional\\nbodies, women’s, youth, environmental and consumer groups, and academic and health care\\ninstitutions, to tobacco control efforts nationally and internationally and the vital importance of\\ntheir participation in national and international tobacco control efforts,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing the need to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or\\nsubvert tobacco control efforts and the need to be informed of activities of the tobacco industry\\nthat have a negative impact on tobacco control efforts,\\n\\n\\n         Recalling Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural\\nRights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 16 December 1966, which states\\nthat it is the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical\\nand mental health,\\n\\n\\n                                                            2\\n---\\n                           WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\n          Recalling also the preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization,\\nwhich states that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the\\nfundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief,\\neconomic or social condition,\\n\\n\\n          Determined to promote measures of tobacco control based on current and relevant\\nscientific, technical and economic considerations,\\n\\n\\n          Recalling    that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination\\nagainst Women, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 18 December 1979,\\nprovides that States Parties to that Convention shall take appropriate measures to eliminate\\ndiscrimination against women in the field of health care,\\n\\n\\n          Recalling further that the Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the United\\nNations General Assembly on 20 November 1989, provides that States Parties to that\\nConvention recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard\\nof health,\\n\\n\\n          Have agreed, as follows:\\n\\n\\n                                                           3\\n---\\n                           WHO Framework Convention on

Every person should be informed of the health consequences, addictive nature and\\nmortal threat posed by tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and effective\\nlegislative, executive, administrative or other measures should be contemplated at the\\nappropriate governmental level to protect all persons from exposure to tobacco smoke.\\n\\n\\n                                                         5\\n---\\n                           WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\n2.        Strong political commitment is necessary to develop and support, at the national,\\nregional and international levels, comprehensive multisectoral measures and coordinated\\nresponses, taking into consideration:\\n\\n\\n          (a)      the need to take measures to protect all persons from exposure to tobacco\\n          smoke;\\n\\n\\n          (b)      the need to take measures to prevent the initiation, to promote and support\\n          cessation, and to decrease the consumption of tobacco products in any form;\\n\\n\\n          (c)      the need to take measures to promote the participation of indigenous individuals\\n          and communities in the development, implementation and evaluation of tobacco control\\n          programmes that are socially and culturally appropriate to their needs and perspectives;\\n          and\\n\\n\\n          (d)      the need to take measures to address gender-specific risks when developing\\n          tobacco control strategies.\\n\\n\\n3.

Issues relating to liability, as determined by each Party within its jurisdiction, are an\\nimportant part of comprehensive tobacco control.\\n\\n\\n6.        The importance of technical and financial assistance to aid the economic transition of\\ntobacco growers and workers whose livelihoods are seriously affected as a consequence of\\ntobacco control programmes in developing country Parties, as well as Parties with economies\\nin transition, should be recognized and addressed in the context of nationally developed\\nstrategies for sustainable development.\\n\\n\\n7.

REQUESTS the Director-General:\\n\\n\\n     (1)      to provide secretariat functions under the Convention until such time as a\\n     permanent secretariat is designated and established;\\n\\n\\n     (2)      to take appropriate steps to provide support to Member States, in particular\\n     developing countries and countries with economies in transition, in preparation for\\n     entry into force of the Convention;\\n\\n\\n     (3)      to convene, as frequently as necessary, between 16 June 2003 and the first\\n     session     of    the   Conference        of    the   Parties,     meetings      of    the  Open-ended\\n     Intergovernmental Working Group;\\n\\n\\n     (4)      to continue to ensure that WHO plays a key role in providing technical advice,\\n     direction and support for global tobacco control;\\n\\n\\n     (5)      to keep the Health Assembly informed of progress made toward entry into\\n     force of the Convention and of preparations under way for the first session of the\\n     Conference of the Parties.\\n\\n\\n                                                     32\\n---\\n                           WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\nAnnex 2:             History of the WHO FCTC process\\n\\n\\n          The idea of an international instrument for tobacco was initiated with the adoption of\\nResolution WHA 48.11 in May 1995, requesting the Director-General to report to the Forty-\\nninth Session of the World Health Assembly on the feasibility of developing an international\\ninstrument such as guidelines, a declaration, or an international convention on tobacco control.\\n\\n\\n          As a result of Resolution WHA48.11, WHO was requested to draft a feasibility study\\nwhich was presented by the Director-General to the Ninety-seventh Session of the WHO\\nExecutive Board (“The Feasibility of an International Instrument for Tobacco Control” (EB97/\\nINF.DOC.4)). During that same session, the Executive Board adopted Resolution EB97.R8,\\n\"International framework convention for tobacco control.\"\\n\\n\\n          Later that year, the Forty-ninth Session of the WHA adopted Resolution WHA49.17,\\n\"International framework convention for tobacco control\", requesting the Director-General to\\ninitiate the development of a Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. As a result of this\\nresolution, WHO\\'s first treaty-making enterprise was formally launched.\\n\\n\\n          In 1998 newly-elected WHO Director-General, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland made global\\ntobacco control a priority through the establishment of a Cabinet Project, the Tobacco Free\\nInitiative, to focus international attention, resources and action upon the global tobacco\\nepidemic. New multisectoral partnerships reflecting the nature of the action were developed.\\nMore importantly, Dr Brundtland worked with Member States to secure a negotiating mandate\\nfor the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and set about the task of mobilizing public\\nand political opinion in favour of global rules for tobacco control.\\n\\n\\n          In May 1999 the Fifty-second World Health Assembly paved the way for multilateral\\nnegotiations on the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and possible related\\nprotocols. Resolution WHA52.18 established two bodies to draft the framework convention, to\\ncomplete negotiations and to submit the final text for consideration by the Fifty-sixth World\\nHealth Assembly. These two bodies included a technical working group to prepare the\\nproposed draft elements of the Framework Convention; and an intergovernmental negotiating\\nbody to draft and negotiate the proposed Framework Convention and possible related\\nprotocols. Both bodies were open to all Member States and regional economic integration\\norganizations to which their Member States had transferred competence over matters related to\\ntobacco control.\\n\\n\\n          The working group held two sessions in Geneva (25-29 October 1999 and 27-29 March\\n2000). Its output was a document with provisional texts of proposed draft elements for the\\nFramework        Convention,       submitted      to   the   Fifty-third    World      Health     Assembly  with\\nthe comments of the working group1 . In Resolution WHA53.16, the Health Assembly called\\nupon the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body to commence negotiations with an initial focus\\n\\n\\n                                                          33\\n---\\n                          WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\non the draft Framework Convention without prejudice to future discussions on possible\\nprotocols, to report progress to the Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly, and to examine the\\nquestion of extended participation by nongovernmental organizations as observers.\\n\\n\\n         The first session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (Geneva, 16-21 October\\n2000) was preceded by a public hearing on issues surrounding the Framework Convention.\\nThe Director-General convened this hearing in order to provide a forum for the public health\\ncommunity, the tobacco industry and farmers’ groups to submit their case; records of the\\nproceedings were made available to the Negotiating Body and, through the WHO web site, to\\nthe public. At the first session, Ambassador Celso Amorim of Brazil was elected as Chair, and\\na bureau was established with Vice-Chairs from Australia, India, Islamic Republic of Iran,\\nSouth Africa, Turkey and the United States of America. The provisional texts of the proposed\\ndraft elements for a WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 2 , which had been\\nprepared by the working group, were accepted as a sound basis for initiating negotiations.\\nSubsequently, Ambassador Amorim prepared a Chair’s text of the Framework Convention on\\nTobacco Control         3 ; this first draft was released in January 2001 as a basis for further\\nnegotiations at the second session.\\n\\n\\n         A report on participation of nongovernmental organizations in the work of the\\nNegotiating Body was presented to the Executive Board at its 107th session in January 20014.\\nIn accordance with the provisions of decision EB107(2) of the Executive Board, the Chairman\\nof the Board acting jointly with the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Non-\\nGovernmental Organizations admitted two nongovernmental organizations, the International\\nNongovernmental Coalition Against Tobacco and Infact, into official relations with WHO as\\nof 26 April 20015 .\\n\\n\\n         In further preparation for the second session of the Negotiating Body, regional\\nintersessional consultations were convened in most regions and subregions. Additional\\nregional and subregional intersessional consultations took place in preparation for each of the\\nsubsequent sessions of the Negotiating Body.\\n\\n\\n         At the second session of the Negotiating Body (Geneva, 30 April – 5 May 2001),\\nresponsibility for consideration of the proposed draft elements was divided between three\\nworking groups. The principal output was the set of three Co-Chairs’ working papers, an\\ninventory of textual proposals made at the session merged with the Chair’s original text. These\\nworking papers became the rolling draft text of the Framework Convention.\\n\\n\\n         At the third session (Geneva, 22-28 November 2001), two working groups issued\\nrevised texts and Working Group One later drafted a text. These documents were used to\\nfurther negotiations during the fourth session.\\n\\n\\n         Having taken over as Permanent Representative of Brazil in Geneva in replacement of\\nAmbassador        Amorim,        Ambassador        Seixas     Corrêa      was    elected     as   Chair  of  the\\n\\n\\n                                                         34\\n---\\n                           WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Body on the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco\\nControl during its fourth session (Geneva, 18-23 March 2002).\\n\\n\\n          It was agreed that Ambassador Seixas Corrêa should prepare a new Chair’s text, which\\nwould form the basis of negotiations during the fifth session of the Negotiating Body (14-25\\nOctober 2002). The text was released in July 2002. An international technical conference on\\nillicit trade in tobacco products was hosted by the United States of America at the United\\nNations Headquarters in New York (30 July – 1 August 2002).\\n\\n\\n          The first four sessions of the Negotiating Body had considered numerous textual\\nalternatives. Concerted deliberations at the fifth session narrowed the options, resulting in\\nmore focused negotiations. After a first reading, in plenary, of the new Chair’s text, six issues\\nwere identified and discussed in open-ended informal meetings: advertising, promotion and\\nsponsorship; financial resources; illicit trade in tobacco products; liability and compensation;\\npackaging and labelling; and trade and health. Informal groups also held discussions on legal,\\ninstitutional and procedural issues and use of terms. Substantial advances in the negotiations\\nwere made and consensus was reached in several areas. On the basis of the outputs of the\\ninformal sessions and the intersessional consultations with various delegations and groups of\\ndelegations, Ambassador Seixas Corrêa issued a revised Chair’s text of a Framework\\nConvention on Tobacco Control on 15 January 2003.\\n\\n\\n          The sixth and final session of the Negotiating Body ran from 17 February - 1 March\\n2003. The negotiations were intense and broad ranging. Two important issues, advertising,\\npromotion and sponsorship and financial resources, were discussed in two informal groups. At\\nthe final plenary meeting, the Negotiating Body agreed to transmit the text to the Fifty-sixth\\nWorld Health Assembly for consideration for adoption in accordance with Article 19 of the\\nConstitution. It also agreed that the discussion of protocols should be postponed until that\\nHealth Assembly, at which there would be time for consideration of the matter. At its final\\nplenary meeting, the Negotiating Body agreed that the Chair of the Negotiating Body should\\ndraft a resolution recommending adoption of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco\\nControl by the Health Assembly6 . The final draft of the WHO Framework Convention on\\nTobacco Control7 was thus submitted to the Health Assembly for consideration for adoption,\\n\\n\\npursuant to Resolution WHA52.18.\\n          On 21 May 2003, the 56th World Health Assembly, unanimously adopted the WHO\\nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control8 . The Convention was opened for signature, for a\\nperiod of one year, from 16 June 2003 to 22 June 2003 at WHO headquarters in Geneva and\\nthereafter at United Nations Headquarters in New York, from 30 June 2003 to 29 June 2004.\\n\\n\\n          The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is a landmark for the future of\\nglobal public health and has major implications for WHO’s health goals. The conclusion of the\\nnegotiating process and the unanimous adoption of the WHO Framework Convention on\\nTobacco Control, in full accordance with Health Assembly resolutions, represents a milestone\\n\\n\\n                                                          35\\n---\\n                        WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\nfor the promotion of public health and provides new legal dimensions for international health\\ncooperation.\\n\\n\\n1 Document A53/12.\\n2 Document A/FCTC/INB1/2.\\n3 Document A/FCTC/INB2/2.\\n4 Document EB107/19.\\n5 Document A/FCTC/INB2/6 Add.1.\\n6 This draft resolution is contained in document A56/8/REV.1.\\n7 See document A56/8, Annex.\\n8 WHO Document WHA56.1\\n\\n\\n                                                     36\\n---\\nThe WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\nwas developed in response to the globalization of the\\ntobacco epidemic.

Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is the first treaty\\nnegotiated under the auspices of the World Health Organization. The WHO FCTC is an\\nevidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health.\\nThe WHO FCTC represents a paradigm shift in developing a regulatory strategy to address\\naddictive substances; in contrast to previous drug control treaties, the WHO FCTC asserts the\\nimportance of demand reduction strategies as well as supply issues.\\n\\n\\n     The WHO FCTC was developed in response to the globalization of the tobacco epidemic.\\nThe spread of the tobacco epidemic is facilitated through a variety of complex factors with\\ncross-border effects, including trade liberalization and direct foreign investment. Other factors\\nsuch as global marketing, transnational tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and\\nthe international movement of contraband and counterfeit cigarettes have also contributed to\\nthe explosive increase in tobacco use.\\n\\n\\n     From the first preambular paragraph, which states that the “Parties to this Convention\\n[are] determined to give priority to their right to protect public health”, the WHO FCTC is a\\nglobal trend-setter.\\n\\n\\n     The core demand reduction provisions in the WHO FCTC are contained in articles 6-14:\\n\\n\\n     Price and tax measures to reduce the demand for tobacco, and\\n\\n\\n     Non-price measures to reduce the demand for tobacco, namely:\\n\\n\\n     \\x83     Protection from exposure to tobacco smoke;\\n     \\x83     Regulation of the contents of tobacco products;\\n     \\x83     Regulation of tobacco product disclosures;\\n     \\x83     Packaging and labelling of tobacco products;\\n     \\x83     Education, communication, training and public awareness;\\n     \\x83     Tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; and,\\n     \\x83     Demand reduction measures concerning tobacco dependence and cessation.\\n\\n\\n     The core supply reduction provisions in the WHO FCTC are contained in articles 15-17:\\n\\n\\n     Illicit trade in tobacco products;\\n     Sales to and by minors; and,\\n     Provision of support for economically viable alternative activities.\\n\\n\\n     Another novel feature of the Convention is the inclusion of a provision that addresses\\nliability. Mechanisms for scientific and technical cooperation and exchange of information are\\nset out in Articles 20-22.\\n\\n\\n                                                          v\\n---\\n                           WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\n      The WHO FCTC opened for signature on 16 June to 22 June 2003 in Geneva, and\\nthereafter at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Depositary of the treaty, from\\n30 June 2003 to 29 June 2004. The treaty, which is now closed for signature, has 168\\nSignatories, including the European Community, which makes it one of the most widely\\nembraced treaties in UN history. Member States that have signed the Convention indicate that\\nthey will strive in good faith to ratify, accept, or approve it, and show political commitment not\\nto undermine the objectives set out in it. Countries wishing to become a Party, but that did not\\nsign the Convention by 29 June 2004, may do so by means of accession, which is a one-step\\nprocess equivalent to ratification.\\n\\n\\n      The Convention entered into force on 27 February 2005 -- 90 days after it has been\\nacceded to, ratified, accepted, or approved by 40 States.                    Beginning on that date, the forty\\nContracting Parties are legally bound by the treaty\\'s provisions. For each State that ratifies,\\naccepts or approves the Convention or accedes thereto after the conditions set out in paragraph\\n1 of Article 36 for entry into force have been fulfilled, the Convention shall enter into force on\\nthe ninetieth day following the date of deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance,\\napproval or accession. For regional economic integration organizations, the Convention enters\\ninto force on the ninetieth day following the date of deposit of its instrument of formal\\nconfirmation or accession.\\n\\n\\n      The global network developed over the period of the negotiations of the WHO FCTC will\\nbe important in preparing for the implementation of the Convention at country level. In the\\nwords of WHO\\'s Director General, Dr Jong-wook LEE:\\n\\n\\n         \"The WHO FCTC negotiations have already unleashed a process that has\\n         resulted in visible differences at country level. The success of the WHO FCTC\\n         as a tool for public health will depend on the energy and political commitment\\n         that we devote to implementing it in countries in the coming years.                                 A\\n         successful result will be global public health gains for all.\"\\n\\n\\n      For this to materialize, the drive and commitment, which was so evident during the\\nnegotiations, will need to spread to national and local levels so that the WHO FCTC becomes a\\nconcrete reality where it counts most, in countries.\\n\\n\\n

right to protect public health,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing that the spread of the tobacco epidemic is a global problem with serious\\nconsequences for public health that calls for the widest possible international cooperation and\\nthe participation of all countries in an effective, appropriate and comprehensive international\\nresponse,\\n\\n\\n         Reflecting the concern of the international community about the devastating worldwide\\nhealth, social, economic and environmental consequences of tobacco consumption and\\nexposure to tobacco smoke,\\n\\n\\n         Seriously concerned about the increase in the worldwide consumption and production\\nof cigarettes and other tobacco products, particularly in developing countries, as well as about\\nthe burden this places on families, on the poor, and on national health systems,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing       that scientific evidence has unequivocally established that tobacco\\nconsumption and exposure to tobacco smoke cause death, disease and disability, and that there\\nis a time lag between the exposure to smoking and the other uses of tobacco products and the\\nonset of tobacco-related diseases,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing also that cigarettes and some other products containing tobacco are highly\\nengineered so as to create and maintain dependence, and that many of the compounds they\\ncontain and the smoke they produce are pharmacologically active, toxic, mutagenic and\\ncarcinogenic, and that tobacco dependence is separately classified as a disorder in major\\ninternational classifications of diseases,\\n\\n\\n         Acknowledging that there is clear scientific evidence that prenatal exposure to tobacco\\nsmoke causes adverse health and developmental conditions for children,\\n\\n\\n         Deeply concerned          about the escalation in smoking and other forms of tobacco\\nconsumption by children and adolescents worldwide, particularly smoking at increasingly\\nearly ages,\\n\\n\\n         Alarmed by the increase in smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by women\\nand young girls worldwide and keeping in mind the need for full participation of women at all\\nlevels of policy-making and implementation and the need for gender-specific tobacco control\\nstrategies,\\n\\n\\n                                                           1\\n---\\n

peoples,\\n\\n\\n         Seriously concerned          about the impact        of  all forms of advertising, promotion and\\nsponsorship aimed at encouraging the use of tobacco products,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing that cooperative action is necessary to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in\\ncigarettes and other tobacco products, including smuggling, illicit manufacturing and\\ncounterfeiting,\\n\\n\\n         Acknowledging         that tobacco control at all levels and particularly in developing\\ncountries and in countries with economies in transition requires sufficient financial and\\ntechnical resources commensurate with the current and projected need for tobacco control\\nactivities,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing the need to develop appropriate mechanisms to address the long-term\\nsocial and economic implications of successful tobacco demand reduction strategies,\\n\\n\\n         Mindful of the social and economic difficulties that tobacco control programmes may\\nengender in the medium and long term in some developing countries and countries with\\neconomies in transition, and recognizing their need for technical and financial assistance in the\\ncontext of nationally developed strategies for sustainable development,\\n\\n\\n         Conscious of the valuable work being conducted by many States on tobacco control and\\ncommending the leadership of the World Health Organization as well as the efforts of other\\norganizations and bodies of the United Nations system and other international and regional\\nintergovernmental organizations in developing measures on tobacco control,\\n\\n\\n         Emphasizing        the special contribution of nongovernmental organizations and other\\nmembers of civil society not affiliated with the tobacco industry, including health professional\\nbodies, women’s, youth, environmental and consumer groups, and academic and health care\\ninstitutions, to tobacco control efforts nationally and internationally and the vital importance of\\ntheir participation in national and international tobacco control efforts,\\n\\n\\n         Recognizing the need to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or\\nsubvert tobacco control efforts and the need to be informed of activities of the tobacco industry\\nthat have a negative impact on tobacco control efforts,\\n\\n\\n         Recalling Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural\\nRights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 16 December 1966, which states\\nthat it is the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical\\nand mental health,\\n\\n\\n

states that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the\\nfundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief,\\neconomic or social condition,\\n\\n\\n          Determined to promote measures of tobacco control based on current and relevant\\nscientific, technical and economic considerations,\\n\\n\\n          Recalling    that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination\\nagainst Women, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 18 December 1979,\\nprovides that States Parties to that

Every person should be informed of the health consequences, addictive nature and\\nmortal threat posed by tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and effective\\nlegislative, executive, administrative or other measures should be contemplated at the\\nappropriate governmental level to protect all persons from exposure to tobacco smoke.\\n\\n\\n                                                         5\\n---\\n                           WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\n2.        Strong political commitment is necessary to develop and support, at the national,\\nregional and international levels, comprehensive multisectoral measures and coordinated\\nresponses, taking into consideration:\\n\\n\\n          (a)      the need to take measures to protect all persons from exposure to tobacco\\n          smoke;\\n\\n\\n          (b)      the need to take measures to prevent the initiation, to promote and support\\n          cessation, and to decrease the consumption of tobacco products in any form;\\n\\n\\n          (c)      the need to take measures to promote the participation of indigenous individuals\\n          and communities in the development, implementation and evaluation of tobacco control\\n          programmes that are socially and culturally appropriate to their needs and perspectives;\\n          and\\n\\n\\n          (d)      the need to take measures to address gender-specific risks when developing\\n          tobacco control strategies.\\n\\n\\n3.        International cooperation, particularly transfer of technology, knowledge and financial\\nassistance and provision of related expertise, to establish and implement effective tobacco\\ncontrol programmes, taking into consideration local culture, as well as social, economic,\\npolitical and legal factors, is an important part of the Convention.\\n\\n\\n4.        Comprehensive multisectoral measures and responses to reduce consumption of all\\ntobacco products at the national, regional and international levels are essential so as to prevent,\\nin accordance with public health principles, the incidence of diseases, premature disability and\\nmortality due to tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke.\\n\\n\\n5.        Issues relating to liability, as determined by each Party within its jurisdiction, are an\\nimportant part of comprehensive tobacco control.\\n\\n\\n6.        The importance of technical and financial assistance to aid the economic transition of\\ntobacco growers and workers whose livelihoods are seriously affected as a consequence of\\ntobacco control programmes in developing country Parties, as well as Parties with economies\\nin transition, should be recognized and addressed in the context of nationally developed\\nstrategies for sustainable development.\\n\\n\\n7.

During that same session, the Executive Board adopted Resolution EB97.R8,\\n\"International framework convention for tobacco control.\"\\n\\n\\n          Later that year, the Forty-ninth Session of the WHA adopted Resolution WHA49.17,\\n\"International framework convention for tobacco control\", requesting the Director-General to\\ninitiate the development of a Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. As a result of this\\nresolution, WHO\\'s first treaty-making enterprise was formally launched.\\n\\n\\n          In 1998 newly-elected WHO Director-General, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland made global\\ntobacco control a priority through the establishment of a Cabinet Project, the Tobacco Free\\nInitiative, to focus international attention, resources and action upon the global tobacco\\nepidemic. New multisectoral partnerships reflecting the nature of the action were developed.\\nMore importantly, Dr Brundtland worked with Member States to secure a negotiating mandate\\nfor the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and set about the task of mobilizing public\\nand political opinion in favour of global rules for tobacco control.\\n\\n\\n          In May 1999 the Fifty-second World Health Assembly paved the way for multilateral\\nnegotiations on the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and possible related\\nprotocols. Resolution WHA52.18 established two bodies to draft the framework convention, to\\ncomplete negotiations and to submit the final text for consideration by the Fifty-sixth World\\nHealth Assembly. These two bodies included a technical working group to prepare the\\nproposed draft elements of the Framework Convention; and an intergovernmental negotiating\\nbody to draft and negotiate the proposed Framework Convention and possible related\\nprotocols. Both bodies were open to all Member States and regional economic integration\\norganizations to which their Member States had transferred competence over matters related to\\ntobacco control.\\n\\n\\n          The working group held two sessions in Geneva (25-29 October 1999 and 27-29 March\\n2000). Its output was a document with provisional texts of proposed draft elements for the\\nFramework        Convention,       submitted      to   the   Fifty-third    World      Health     Assembly  with\\nthe comments of the working group1 . In Resolution WHA53.16, the Health Assembly called\\nupon the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body to commence negotiations with an initial focus\\n\\n\\n                                                          33\\n---\\n                          WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\non the draft Framework Convention without prejudice to future discussions on possible\\nprotocols, to report progress to the Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly, and to examine the\\nquestion of extended participation by nongovernmental organizations as observers.\\n\\n\\n         The first session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (Geneva, 16-21 October\\n2000) was preceded by a public hearing on issues surrounding the Framework Convention.\\nThe Director-General convened this hearing in order to provide a forum for the public health\\ncommunity, the tobacco industry and farmers’ groups to submit their case; records of the\\nproceedings were made available to the Negotiating Body and, through the WHO web site, to\\nthe public. At the first session, Ambassador Celso Amorim of Brazil was elected as Chair, and\\na bureau was established with Vice-Chairs from Australia, India, Islamic Republic of Iran,\\nSouth Africa, Turkey and the United States of America. The provisional texts of the proposed\\ndraft elements for a WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 2 , which had been\\nprepared by the working group, were accepted as a sound basis for initiating negotiations.\\nSubsequently, Ambassador Amorim prepared a Chair’s text of the Framework Convention on\\nTobacco Control         3 ; this first draft was released in January 2001 as a basis for further\\nnegotiations at the second session.\\n\\n\\n         A report on participation of nongovernmental organizations in the work of the\\nNegotiating Body was presented to the Executive Board at its 107th session in January 20014.\\nIn accordance with the provisions of decision EB107(2) of the Executive Board, the Chairman\\nof the Board acting jointly with the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Non-\\nGovernmental Organizations admitted two nongovernmental organizations, the International\\nNongovernmental Coalition Against Tobacco and Infact, into official relations with WHO as\\nof 26 April 20015 .\\n\\n\\n         In further preparation for the second session of the Negotiating Body, regional\\nintersessional consultations were convened in most regions and subregions. Additional\\nregional and subregional intersessional consultations took place in preparation for each of the\\nsubsequent sessions of the Negotiating Body.\\n\\n\\n         At the second session of the Negotiating Body (Geneva, 30 April – 5 May 2001),\\nresponsibility for consideration of the proposed draft elements was divided between three\\nworking groups. The principal output was the set of three Co-Chairs’ working papers, an\\ninventory of textual proposals made at the session merged with the Chair’s original text. These\\nworking papers became the rolling draft text of the Framework Convention.\\n\\n\\n         At the third session (Geneva, 22-28 November 2001), two working groups issued\\nrevised texts and Working Group One later drafted a text. These documents were used to\\nfurther negotiations during the fourth session.\\n\\n\\n         Having taken over as Permanent Representative of Brazil in Geneva in replacement of\\nAmbassador        Amorim,        Ambassador        Seixas     Corrêa      was    elected     as   Chair  of  the\\n\\n\\n                                                         34\\n---\\n                           WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Body on the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco\\nControl during its fourth session (Geneva, 18-23 March 2002).\\n\\n\\n          It was agreed that Ambassador Seixas Corrêa should prepare a new Chair’s text, which\\nwould form the basis of negotiations during the fifth session of the Negotiating Body (14-25\\nOctober 2002). The text was released in July 2002. An international technical conference on\\nillicit trade in tobacco products was hosted by the United States of America at the United\\nNations Headquarters in New York (30 July – 1 August 2002).\\n\\n\\n          The first four sessions of the Negotiating Body had considered numerous textual\\nalternatives. Concerted deliberations at the fifth session narrowed the options, resulting in\\nmore focused negotiations. After a first reading, in plenary, of the new Chair’s text, six issues\\nwere identified and discussed in open-ended informal meetings: advertising, promotion and\\nsponsorship; financial resources; illicit trade in tobacco products; liability and compensation;\\npackaging and labelling; and trade and health. Informal groups also held discussions on legal,\\ninstitutional and procedural issues and use of terms. Substantial advances in the negotiations\\nwere made and consensus was reached in several areas. On the basis of the outputs of the\\ninformal sessions and the intersessional consultations with various delegations and groups of\\ndelegations, Ambassador Seixas Corrêa issued a revised Chair’s text of a Framework\\nConvention on Tobacco Control on 15 January 2003.\\n\\n\\n          The sixth and final session of the Negotiating Body ran from 17 February - 1 March\\n2003. The negotiations were intense and broad ranging. Two important issues, advertising,\\npromotion and sponsorship and financial resources, were discussed in two informal groups. At\\nthe final plenary meeting, the Negotiating Body agreed to transmit the text to the Fifty-sixth\\nWorld Health Assembly for consideration for adoption in accordance with Article 19 of the\\nConstitution. It also agreed that the discussion of protocols should be postponed until that\\nHealth Assembly, at which there would be time for consideration of the matter. At its final\\nplenary meeting, the Negotiating Body agreed that the Chair of the Negotiating Body should\\ndraft a resolution recommending adoption of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco\\nControl by the Health Assembly6 . The final draft of the WHO Framework Convention on\\nTobacco Control7 was thus submitted to the Health Assembly for consideration for adoption,\\n\\n\\npursuant to Resolution WHA52.18.\\n          On 21 May 2003, the 56th World Health Assembly, unanimously adopted the WHO\\nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control8 . The Convention was opened for signature, for a\\nperiod of one year, from 16 June 2003 to 22 June 2003 at WHO headquarters in Geneva and\\nthereafter at United Nations Headquarters in New York, from 30 June 2003 to 29 June 2004.\\n\\n\\n          The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is a landmark for the future of\\nglobal public health and has major implications for WHO’s health goals. The conclusion of the\\nnegotiating process and the unanimous adoption of the WHO Framework Convention on\\nTobacco Control, in full accordance with Health Assembly resolutions, represents a milestone\\n\\n\\n                                                          35\\n---\\n                        WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\n\\n\\nfor the promotion of public health and provides new legal dimensions for international health\\ncooperation.\\n\\n\\n1 Document A53/12.\\n2 Document A/FCTC/INB1/2.\\n3 Document A/FCTC/INB2/2.\\n4 Document EB107/19.\\n5 Document A/FCTC/INB2/6 Add.1.\\n6 This draft resolution is contained in document A56/8/REV.1.\\n7 See document A56/8, Annex.\\n8 WHO Document WHA56.1\\n\\n\\n                                                     36\\n---\\nThe WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\\nwas developed in response to the globalization of the\\ntobacco epidemic.

The auditor role\\nwill most probably be akin to a Data Protection Officer (DPO), possibly from an\\nexternal third-party organisation and involve activities outside of the Consent\\nBuilding Block.\\nTo avoid ambiguity, we use the precise term Data Processing Auditor to stress\\nthe specificity of tasks to be performed by and for the Consent Building Block; all\\nother actions not within the Consent Building Block's scope are considered as an\\nexternal prerequisite and as a “black box” activity. With respect to audit, this role\\nis distinguished from the data policy auditor. The Data Processing Auditor relies\\non an audit universe defined by the control and risk management of the specific\\nproject and context (i.e. outside the Consent Building Block). “Who needs to\\nconsent to what” is the outcome of a DPIA (Data Protection Impact Analysis),\\nensuring that the data policies are compliant with the relevant data protection\\nregulations for the project.\\nThe main actions a Data Processing Auditor (or Data Protection Officer, DPO) is\\nexpected to perform via Consent Building Block are:\\n\\n\\n        auditing tracking the consents (opt-in/opt-out);\\n\\n\\n        auditing tracking Data Policy changes and configuration conformance with\\n        it;\\n\\n\\n        viewing (reading, exporting) the Consent Agreements and relevant reports\\n        in a verifiable form.\\nFor the implementation of a specific use case, it is important to distinguish the\\nData Processing Auditor, an actor described here, from a data policy auditor, an\\nactor of the risk organisation. It is expected that the two roles are coordinated in\\nthe risk management process. Within the Consent Building Block, the Data\\nProcessing Auditor performs the tasks that will allow a data policy auditor to\\nconfirm that the implemented system complies with existing regulations\\ndemanding consent.The table below summarises the key use cases identified for\\nthe Data Processing Auditor.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                25\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2542, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8397289514541626), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='5b0709c0-7253-496e-96ab-499635cb5117', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ccb21474-eea0-46e5-ba12-a4bf6c57c4bd', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={}, hash='e1cb1e0ecf62c3bcad209c1d1626ba914e72721359284250bb0bcdf482eed404')}, text='Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\\n\\nAuthentication and authorization -> Is handled -> Outside of consent building block\\n\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\n        When a person is simply informed of the processing of the data by the\\n        organisation as part of the service provided under contract or by an\\n        authority.\\n\\n\\n        When consent does not have to be obtained in a situation where the entity\\n        does not identify or cannot identify people with reasonable effort.\\n\\n\\nAssumptions\\nLays out the pre-conditions needed for anyone to use the Consent Building Block.\\n    1. Data Disclosure Agreements between organisations are already in place.\\n        For example, a healthcare organisation has already got the required\\n        authorisation to use the citizen data registry.\\n    2. To link a Consent Agreement with the specific Individual, Consent Building\\n        Block assumes the authentication and authorization to be handled in a\\n        trusted manner outside of it (see below).\\n    3. Within the early scope of the Consent Building Block, the act of delegating\\n        is kept outside the scope of the Consent Building Block. It is assumed that\\n        the authorisation to act on behalf of someone else is already resolved.\\n    4. It is the organization\\'s (a Data Provider or a Data Consumer) obligation to\\n        manage and implement internal policies toward its employees relating to\\n        their responsibilities for Personal Data processing integrity, specifying it in\\n        the employment contract or by other means.\\nConsent Agreement Lifecycle\\nThe life cycle of a consent agreement starts and ends within the organisation\\nresponsible for the information system. The organisation knows the context in\\nwhich the information system operates and the intended purpose of the service.\\nThe rules and regulations to be applied for a given level of assurance define the\\nfunctional framework for consent management.\\nConsent Building Block deals with transparency on data usage in a given context.\\nThus privacy-by-design of the system\\'s actors is often an excellent guiding\\nprinciple for interpreting international, national, and organisational policies and\\ngovernance principles to implement the functional consent framework. A\\ntangible outcome from a Data Protection Impact Analysis (DPIA) is a structured\\napproach that can deliver the input for the actual implementation of the Consent\\nBuilding Block.\\nIndividual consent is captured within the context of digital interaction. This\\ninteraction is composite of all the information systems involved, not solely the\\nConsent Building Block. Thus, the legal and ethical boundaries of consent are\\ndefined in the entirety of the interaction. In particular, consent, as defined by\\nISO/TS 17975:2015(E), should be seen as a \"set of agreements and constraints\"\\nthat an informed and knowledgeable [individual] agrees to apply to their data\\nprocessing. This definition, not based on the purpose of the data usage, can lead\\nto a consent management framework also incorporating authorisations or\\nunrelated constraints of the system.

Its key\\npurpose is to allow individuals to view Consent Agreements and sign or withdraw\\ntheir consent on what Personal Data is used and accessible to organisations. It\\nalso clarifies the Data Policy applied, such as the purpose, retention period,\\njurisdiction, third-party data sharing, etc.\\nThe Consent Building Block implements the key functionalities described in the\\nconsent management lifecycle. It includes the ability to configure consent\\nagreements by an organisation admin, present consent requests towards\\nindividuals, capture consents, enable queries if consent exists, or not, and enable\\nindependent audit of consents.\\nThe functionalities are derived from the consent agreement lifecycle and\\ncategorised according to the Actors described above. While the consenting\\nworkflows (as described above) are implicitly considered the centrepiece of the\\nConsent Building Block, it is important to realise that the integrity of consent\\nmanagement can only be achieved if robust configuration before and auditing\\nafter the Consent Agreement signing and Consent Record verification activities\\nare in place. Hence, the functionalities are described following the logical\\nsequence of the consent agreement lifecycle and they are all equally important\\ncomponents of the Consent Building Block.\\nThe Consent process (creating and signing Consent Agreements and Consent\\nRecords) is initially managed in the application provided by the Organisation that\\nis legally required to collect the consent. Since it can be either a Data Consuming\\norganisation or a Data Providing organisation, the Consent Building Block allows\\nboth to be able to verify their conformance with the underlying Data Policy, both\\norganisations must be able to access and use the application.\\nWhile the Actors generally fall in line with the categories of the functionalities, it\\nis important to realise that “auditing” functions in the narrow sense, verifying if\\n\\n\\n                                                                                         22', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3259, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7675833702087402)]\n"

With respect to audit, this role\\nis distinguished from the data policy auditor. The Data Processing Auditor relies\\non an audit universe defined by the control and risk management of the specific\\nproject and context (i.e. outside the Consent Building Block). “Who needs to\\nconsent to what” is the outcome of a DPIA (Data Protection Impact Analysis),\\nensuring that the data policies are compliant with the relevant data protection\\nregulations for the project.\\nThe main actions a Data Processing Auditor (or Data Protection Officer, DPO) is\\nexpected to perform via Consent Building Block are:\\n\\n\\n        auditing tracking the consents (opt-in/opt-out);\\n\\n\\n        auditing tracking Data Policy changes and configuration conformance with\\n        it;\\n\\n\\n        viewing (reading, exporting) the Consent Agreements and relevant reports\\n        in a verifiable form.\\nFor the implementation of a specific use case, it is important to distinguish the\\nData Processing Auditor, an actor described here, from a data policy auditor, an\\nactor of the risk organisation. It is expected that the two roles are coordinated in\\nthe risk management process. Within the Consent Building Block, the Data\\nProcessing Auditor performs the tasks that will allow a data policy auditor to\\nconfirm that the implemented system complies with existing regulations\\ndemanding consent.The table below summarises the key use cases identified for\\nthe Data Processing Auditor.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                25\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2542, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8585330247879028), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='5b0709c0-7253-496e-96ab-499635cb5117', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ccb21474-eea0-46e5-ba12-a4bf6c57c4bd', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={}, hash='e1cb1e0ecf62c3bcad209c1d1626ba914e72721359284250bb0bcdf482eed404')}, text='Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\\n\\nAuthentication and authorization -> Is handled -> Outside of consent building block\\n\\nSource: GovStack | 23Q4 | GovStack Specification (gitbook.io)\\n\\n\\n        When a person is simply informed of the processing of the data by the\\n        organisation as part of the service provided under contract or by an\\n        authority.\\n\\n\\n        When consent does not have to be obtained in a situation where the entity\\n        does not identify or cannot identify people with reasonable effort.\\n\\n\\nAssumptions\\nLays out the pre-conditions needed for anyone to use the Consent Building Block.\\n    1. Data Disclosure Agreements between organisations are already in place.\\n        For example, a healthcare organisation has already got the required\\n        authorisation to use the citizen data registry.\\n    2. To link a Consent Agreement with the specific Individual, Consent Building\\n        Block assumes the authentication and authorization to be handled in a\\n        trusted manner outside of it (see below).\\n    3. Within the early scope of the Consent Building Block, the act of delegating\\n        is kept outside the scope of the Consent Building Block. It is assumed that\\n        the authorisation to act on behalf of someone else is already resolved.\\n    4. It is the organization\\'s (a Data Provider or a Data Consumer) obligation to\\n        manage and implement internal policies toward its employees relating to\\n        their responsibilities for Personal Data processing integrity, specifying it in\\n        the employment contract or by other means.\\nConsent Agreement Lifecycle\\nThe life cycle of a consent agreement starts and ends within the organisation\\nresponsible for the information system. The organisation knows the context in\\nwhich the information system operates and the intended purpose of the service.\\nThe rules and regulations to be applied for a given level of assurance define the\\nfunctional framework for consent management.\\nConsent Building Block deals with transparency on data usage in a given context.\\nThus privacy-by-design of the system\\'s actors is often an excellent guiding\\nprinciple for interpreting international, national, and organisational policies and\\ngovernance principles to implement the functional consent framework. A\\ntangible outcome from a Data Protection Impact Analysis (DPIA) is a structured\\napproach that can deliver the input for the actual implementation of the Consent\\nBuilding Block.\\nIndividual consent is captured within the context of digital interaction. This\\ninteraction is composite of all the information systems involved, not solely the\\nConsent Building Block. Thus, the legal and ethical boundaries of consent are\\ndefined in the entirety of the interaction. In particular, consent, as defined by\\nISO/TS 17975:2015(E), should be seen as a \"set of agreements and constraints\"\\nthat an informed and knowledgeable [individual] agrees to apply to their data\\nprocessing. This definition, not based on the purpose of the data usage, can lead\\nto a consent management framework also incorporating authorisations or\\nunrelated constraints of the system.

Its key\\npurpose is to allow individuals to view Consent Agreements and sign or withdraw\\ntheir consent on what Personal Data is used and accessible to organisations. It\\nalso clarifies the Data Policy applied, such as the purpose, retention period,\\njurisdiction, third-party data sharing, etc.\\nThe Consent Building Block implements the key functionalities described in the\\nconsent management lifecycle. It includes the ability to configure consent\\nagreements by an organisation admin, present consent requests towards\\nindividuals, capture consents, enable queries if consent exists, or not, and enable\\nindependent audit of consents.\\nThe functionalities are derived from the consent agreement lifecycle and\\ncategorised according to the Actors described above. While the consenting\\nworkflows (as described above) are implicitly considered the centrepiece of the\\nConsent Building Block, it is important to realise that the integrity of consent\\nmanagement can only be achieved if robust configuration before and auditing\\nafter the Consent Agreement signing and Consent Record verification activities\\nare in place. Hence, the functionalities are described following the logical\\nsequence of the consent agreement lifecycle and they are all equally important\\ncomponents of the Consent Building Block.\\nThe Consent process (creating and signing Consent Agreements and Consent\\nRecords) is initially managed in the application provided by the Organisation that\\nis legally required to collect the consent. Since it can be either a Data Consuming\\norganisation or a Data Providing organisation, the Consent Building Block allows\\nboth to be able to verify their conformance with the underlying Data Policy, both\\norganisations must be able to access and use the application.\\nWhile the Actors generally fall in line with the categories of the functionalities, it\\nis important to realise that “auditing” functions in the narrow sense, verifying if\\n\\n\\n                                                                                         22', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3259, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7716248035430908)]\n"
